# node-red-contrib-gps4net

## Description

This repository contains custom Node-RED nodes for GPS4NET, designed to manage the G4NRHT family of temperature and humidity sensors. These nodes facilitate communication over the CAN-BUS.

The nodes **g4nrht-decode** and **g4nrht-encode** are responsible for these communication aspects. They translate the interactions into usable Node-RED messages that can be used for monitoring or configuring networks of sensors.

The node **g4nrht-dashboard** provides a GUI interface for browsers. It leverages the **g4nrht-decode** and **g4nrht-encode** nodes to configure the network of sensors connected to it.

## Dependencies

No dependencies are required to install these nodes. However, for these nodes to function, a working CAN-BUS connection must be provided via any transport protocol (e.g., MQTT).

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies needed for installing these nodes.
However for the functioning of these nodes there must be a working CAN-BUS connection provided via any transport protocol (MQTT etc).

### Installation & Configuration

To install the nodes and use the provided examples, you can install them via the Manage Palette -> Install (tab) -> Search for "gps4net" and click "install".

![Installatin via pallete](./images/install.png)
Alternatively, you can install by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install node-red-contrib-gps4net
```

## Usage for g4nrht-decode and g4nrht encode nodes

Examples are provided with the import function to help you get started.

Usually, the two nodes are used together. The **g4nrht-decode** function is responsible for translating (decoding) CAN frames to higher-level data, such as messages with a topic and payload that can be used in any Node-RED flow.

The **g4nrht-encode** does the opposite, receiving high-level messages tailored for the RHT sensors and translating them into CAN frames to be used for configuring the temperature and humidity sensors.

**g4nrht-decode** is a node that decodes CAN frames from G4NRHT temperature and humidity sensors to higher-level data.

![Adding example flows](./images/import_examples.png)

The provided example flow gives a working example that must be connected to a CAN-BUS network, either directly or via any other transmission protocol that transports the CAN frames, such as MQTT.

![Example of the flow](./images/decode_example.png)

In this example, we have removed the links for in and out CAN-BUS communication with socketcan connections, but these can be easily substituted for MQTT connections or any other type.

![Example of the G4NRHT decode and encode nodes connected using socket can](./images/decode_socketcan_example.png)

When used together, these nodes can extract meaningful real-time data that can be parsed, graphed, stored, and tailored to any use case. To support this, the **g4nrht-decode** node has rules that can be applied to parse its output to a specific payload if we are only interested in a few parameters. The rules can sort by PSN (product serial number) if one is specified, or can apply filter rules to all sensors as described below. The outputs will be generated as you create new rules so that you can directly use the filtered message.

![Example of rht-decode rules](./images/decode_settings_rules.png)

## Usage of the g4nrht-dashboard

The **g4nrht-dashboard** has a fully functioning GUI dashboard implemented that uses the **g4nrht** encode and decode nodes as its inputs and outputs. Its example can be imported in the same way as described above, and the comments will guide you in linking the two flows together.

![Image of the g4nrht-dashboard node](./images/dashboard_flow.png)

The node exposes all the available configuration functionality of a **g4nrht sensor** and is ready to use as soon as it is linked to the **g4nrht example** provided. The GUI is built with native Node-RED GUI components that can be changed with any tailored solution as long as the topic conditions described in the outputs/input section are met. The node comes with an HTML template as a color theme that can be customized according to your needs.

![Image of the dashboard deployed on local host](./images/dashboard_configuration_ui.png)

-   The core functionality relies on querying (reading) the configuration of a sensor and writing it (programing it). The dashboard simplifies this process and provides a graphical interface.

-   **Refresh** the node will place the devices on the network in programming node and listen to their messages. This shall trigger the psn list to be built. A graphical
    After a shor while 30-40sec the device enumeration should be complete. The sensors will be commanded to exit programming mode after 5 minutes of innactivity.
    -   While reading the list / in programming mode a spinner will be displayed at the right of the button.
-   **Query device** selecting the desired PSN and quering (reading the device), the node will trigger a enter programming mode and wait for the selected device to answer. After the device has responded succesfully it will send query messages to the **g4nrht-encode** that will be translated into can frames and interpret the answers it receives from **g4nrht-decode**, it shall do so until all the configuration parameters are queried. Then it will exit programming mode.
    -   While querying a spinner will apear near the refresh button (signifing the network is in programming mode) and near the selected PSN.
-   **Program device** After the parameters have been read, the user can then change them and press the program device button a enter programming mode will be sent via the encode node and after the sensor responds that it is in programming mode a sequence of programming messages will be sent with confirmation. After each programming step is confirmed the sensors will be transmitted exit programming mode can frame.
    -   While programming a spinner will apear near the refresh button (signifing the network is in programming mode) and near the selected PSN.
-   The exact composing of messages and their topics is described in the inputs/outputs of the **g4nrht-dashboard** section.

### Outputs

#### Rules

Each rule is a composite filter that sets up an additional output and has two settings:

1.  **PSN** - The sensor's PSN or `FFFFFFFF` for any of the sensors
2.  **Metric** - The metric that one wants on the output: temperature, humidity, I/O voltage values for the different scenarios: instantaneous samples, average values, alarm values when a temperature, humidity or I/O alarm is triggered. By default the metric is set up to output full message objects.

-   Full message

    payload object | number

    by default the node translates and outputs every message that is given on the output in a JSON object with the following keys:

    -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
    -   **type** - The message type, string.
    -   **epoch** - The UNIX epoch of the message, integer.

    Additional keys will also be present depending on message type, described in the **Unsolicited messages** and **Command messages** sections. If any other metric than _Full message_ is selected, the payload will contain an integer or a floating pint number representing the selected metric's value. The _dew point_ metric os computed based on the temperature and humidity.

    topic string

    the message topic is uses the following format:

    -   `PSN` if the output is configured to supply the full message.
    -   `PSN/metric` if the output is configured to supply a temperature, humidity or I/O voltage value.

## g4nrht-dashboard

**g4nrht-dashboard** takes the data provided by the decode node and allows the reading and programming of a connected temperature and humidity sensor using a simple dashboard.

The dashboard node is design to operate by reading existing parameters of a specific sensor identified by PSN and then writing parameters to that specific sensor.

### Inputs

The input node has a dual role. First role is to receive the messages coming from the g4nrht-decode node. The messages received from the decode node follow the JSON object comprised from a payload with different values and a topic.

Incoming messages take the form of a JSON object with the following keys:
**payload**:

-   Message

    payload object

    Input message payload takes the form of a JSON object with the following keys:

    -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
    -   **canid** - The sample's CAN ID, optional.
    -   **epoch** - The sample's epoch time, 4 byte integer.
    -   **type** - The message type, string.

Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in g4nrht-decode. These are described in the **g4nrht-decode** node.

The second role is to receive the messages from the GUI elements (or simple messages injected by user) and act accordingly by triggering sequences of messages sent to the encode node.
The messages have a structure that follows these rules:

-   **Message**

    -   **topic** - Incoming messages will have a topic reflecting the ui element control type usually a string type.
    -   **payload** - will usually contain only the numeric or boolean value corresponding to the topic

### Outputs

The output of the first output is connected to the **g4nrht-encode** and sends the messages needed to comunicate/program with the sensors. The other outputs serve a simple message structure to generic gui elements.While the generic gui elements do not require a topic to receive data and display it they do require they send data with a topic so they may be recognised from other messages using the input node.

-   **Message**

    payload object

    Output message payload takes the form of a JSON object with the following keys:

    -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
    -   **canid** - The sample's CAN ID, optional.
    -   **epoch** - The sample's epoch time, 4 byte integer.
    -   **type** - The message type, string.

Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in **g4nrht-decode**.

### Additional notes

The dashboard node works in conjunction with the **g4nrht-decode** and **g4nrht-encode** nodes, forming a system that allows for easy sensor configuration and monitoring.

Please refer to the respective nodes for more detailed information about their functions and how they interact with this node.

Ensure that your sensor and CAN bus are properly set up and functioning correctly before using this node.

Proper usage of this node and the programming functions it provides will ensure optimal performance of your sensor and network.
