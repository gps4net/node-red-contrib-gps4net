Custom Node-RED nodes for GPS4NET

## g4n03rht-decode

**g4n03rht-decode** is a node that decodes CAN frames from G4N03RHT temperature and humidity sensors to higher level data.

### Inputs

-   CAN frame

    payload object

    The input is in the form of a JSON object in **socketcan** format, with the following content:

    ```
    {
        timestamp: 1680699437931,
        ext: true,
        canid: 0x18ff8100,
        dlc: 8,
        rtr: false,
        data: [2,1,0,7,116,96,51,88]
    }
    ```

    -   **canid** - The standard or extended CAN id.
    -   **ext** - Set to true if this is a extended id frame. False otherwise.
    -   **rtr** - Specifies a remote transmission request frame if set to true.
    -   **dlc** - Number of databytes.
    -   **data** - An array with data or null or an empty array if no data.
    -   **timestamp** - Relative timestamp in microseconds

### Outputs

#### Rules

Each rule is a composite filter that sets up an additional output and has two settings:

1.  **PSN** - The sensor's PSN or `FFFFFFFF` for any of the sensors
2.  **Metric** - The metric that one wants on the output: temperature, humidity, I/O voltage values for the different scenarios: instantaneous samples, average values, alarm values when a temperature, humidity or I/O alarm is triggered. By default the metric is set up to output full message objects.

-   Full message

    payload object | number

    by default the node translates and outputs every message that is given on the output in a JSON object with the following keys:

    -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
    -   **type** - The message type, string.
    -   **epoch** - The UNIX epoch of the message, integer.

    Additional keys will also be present depending on message type, described in the **Unsolicited messages** and **Command messages** sections. If any other metric than _Full message_ is selected, the payload will contain an integer or a floating pint number representing the selected metric's value. The _dew point_ metric os computed based on the temperature and humidity.

    topic string

    the message topic is uses the following format:

    -   `PSN` if the output is configured to supply the full message.
    -   `PSN/metric` if the output is configured to supply a temperature, humidity or I/O voltage value.

## Sensor_dashboard

**Sensor_dashboard** takes the data provided by the decode node and allows the reading and programming of a connected temperature and humidity sensor using a simple dashboard.

The dashboard node is design to operate by reading existing parameters of a specific sensor identified by PSN and then writing parameters to that specific sensor.

###Inputs
The input node has a dual role. First role is to receive the messages coming from the g4n03rht-decode node. The messages received from the decode node follow the JSON object comprised from a payload with different values and a topic.

Incoming messages take the form of a JSON object with the following keys:
**payload**:

```
{
canid: The sensor canid,
epoch : The sensor  epoch,
type:  The message type, string
}
```

Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in g4n03rht-decode. These are described in the **g4n03rht node**.

The second role is to receive the messages from the gui elements (or simple message injected by user) and act accordingly by triggering sequences of messages sent to the encode node.
The gui messages have a structure that follows these rules:

-   **Message**

**topic**
Incoming messages will have a topic reflecting the ui element control type usually a string type.

```
	topic:"sensor_enable"
```

**payload**
will usually contain only the value or boolean corresponding to the topic

```
 	{
	value: boolean/numeric
	}
```

###Outputs
The output of the first output is connected to the **g4n03rht-encode** and sends the messages needed to comunicate/program with the sensors. The other outputs serve a simple message structure to generic gui elements.While the generic gui elements do not require a topic to receive data and display it they do require they send data with a topic so they may be recognised from other messages using the input node.

-**Message**
**payload**
Incoming messages take the form of a JSON object with the following keys:

```
{
psn:"The sensor's PSN"
canid:"The sensor's canid",
epoch:"The sensor's epoch",
type:"The message type, string"
}
```

Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in **g4n03rht-decode**. These are described in the **g4n03rht-decode node**.

Using an array of strings (detected sensor psn's), it allows the setting of the variable needed to program/ interogate a specific sensor. This list of arrays is re-generated by pressing the refresh button or at the start of the flow. The dashboard places the sensors comunicating on CAN in programming mode and waits for them to respond and adds them to the array. Its shall check that no new psn announces itself by waiting for each sensor to enumerate 3 times and them exit programming mode, allowing sensors to return to normal operation.

Corresponds to the **prog** type of message as described in **g4n03rht-decode**.

###Additional notes
The dashboard node works in conjunction with the **g4n03rht-decode** and **g4n03rht-encode** nodes, forming a system that allows for easy sensor configuration and monitoring.

Please refer to the respective nodes for more detailed information about their functions and how they interact with this node.

Ensure that your sensor and CAN network are properly set up and functioning correctly before using this node.

Proper usage of this node and the programming functions it provides will ensure optimal performance of your sensor and network.
