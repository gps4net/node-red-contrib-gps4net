  ## g4nrht-dashboard
  **g4nrht-dashboard** takes the data provided by the decode node and allows the reading and programming of a connected temperature and humidity sensor using a simple dashboard.

  The dashboard node is design to operate by reading existing parameters of a specific sensor identified by PSN and then writing parameters to that specific sensor.

  ### Inputs

  The input node has a dual role. First role is to receive the messages coming from the g4nrht-decode node. The messages received from the decode node follow the JSON object comprised from a payload with different values and a topic.

  Incoming messages take the form of a JSON object with the following keys:
  **payload**:

  -   Message

      payload object

      Input message payload takes the form of a JSON object with the following keys:

      -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
      -   **canid** - The sample's CAN ID, optional.
      -   **epoch** - The sample's epoch time, 4 byte integer.
      -   **type** - The message type, string.

      Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in g4nrht-decode. These are described in the **g4nrht-decode** node.

  The second role is to receive the messages from the GUI elements (or simple messages injected by user) and act accordingly by triggering sequences of messages sent to the encode node.
  The messages have a structure that follows these rules:

  -   **Message**

      - **topic** - Incoming messages will have a topic reflecting the ui element control type usually a string type.
      - **payload** - will usually contain only the numeric or boolean value corresponding to the topic

  ### Outputs

  The output of the first output is connected to the **g4nrht-encode** and sends the messages needed to comunicate/program with the sensors. The other outputs serve a simple message structure to generic gui elements.While the generic gui elements do not require a topic to receive data and display it they do require they send data with a topic so they may be recognised from other messages using the input node.

  - **Message**

      payload object

      Output message payload takes the form of a JSON object with the following keys:

      -   **psn** - The sensor's PSN (product serial number), 4 byte hex string.
      -   **canid** - The sample's CAN ID, optional.
      -   **epoch** - The sample's epoch time, 4 byte integer.
      -   **type** - The message type, string.

  Additional keys for parameters will also be present depending on message type as described in **g4nrht-decode**.

  ```
  {
    topic: "sensor_enable",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  ### Topics and command sequences triggered by GUI elements

  The name of topics is described below, along with the action sequence it triggers.

  ```
  {
    topic: "refresh",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  Using a boolean value of `true` or `false` shall trigger a search of sensor PSNs on the CAN bus, shall clear all node variables, place the sensors in programming mode and wait for their response. After the dropdown is filled with sensor PSNs, it shall exit the programming mode.

  ```
  {
    topic: "query_psn",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  Using a boolean value of `true` or `false` shall trigger the query of a specific sensor, reading its configuration settings.

  If the sensor in the CAN bus is not in programming mode, it shall be switched to programming mode. After the sensor's response, commands shall be sent to query  its configuration. Finally, when the query sequence is complete the sensor will be switched back to reporting mode.

  ```
  {
    topic: "begin_programming",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  Using a boolean value of `true` or `false` shall trigger programming of a specific sensor using the settings displayed on the GUI.

  If the sensor in the CAN bus is not in programming mode, it shall be switched to programming mode. After the sensor's response, commands shall be sent to query  its configuration. Finally, when the query sequence is complete the sensor will be switched back to reporting mode.

    payload: array
  }
  ```

  This control allows the querying or programming of a specific sensor, using an array of strings (detected sensor PSNs). This list is always generated at the start of the flow or by pressing the refresh button. The dashboard places the sensors on the CAN bus in programming mode and waits for their responses to add them to the list. It checks that no new PSN announces itself by waiting for each sensor to announce itself three times and then exits programming mode, allowing sensors to return to normal operation.

  ```
  {
    topic: "query/programming mode ready confirmation",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  This control indicates whether the selected sensor has entered programming mode.

  ```

    payload: string
  }
  ```

  This control displays the sqlected sensor's PSN.

  ```
  {
    topic: "switch_programming_mode",
    payload: true|false
  }
  ```

  This control triggers programming mode manually. It's generally used for debuging purposes and not present in the example dashboard. This issues a message of the **prog** type, with its content as described in **g4nrht-decode**.

  ### Additional notes

  The dashboard node works in conjunction with the **g4nrht-decode** and **g4nrht-encode** nodes, forming a system that allows for easy sensor configuration and monitoring.

  Please refer to the respective nodes for more detailed information about their functions and how they interact with this node.

  Ensure that your sensor and CAN bus are properly set up and functioning correctly before using this node.

  Proper usage of this node and the programming functions it provides will ensure optimal performance of your sensor and network.
